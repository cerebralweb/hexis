        <p> It was the first time that I got in Pepe Ganga thinking like a father. I can shamelessly affirm that in the past
          I used to take advantage of my walks through the shopping center to enter to that place just to see toys; me
          weakness were always the transformers. Now the reason to enter was Bernardo, and I was heading
          directly to the newborns section. By looking at the labels and details of
           each product, I began to think as an ethnographer - and marketer, and then a vision
          materialized: many visits, statistics, interviews, and this article </p>
        <p> On one of those visits I scribbled the following list of topics to cover in my field journal:
        </p>

        <h2 id = "problem"> The problem </h2>
        <p> How to sell a generation of parents concerned about safety? (In this text
          we analyze
          possible gaps in baby brands.) For that purpose we follow a hybrid method. </p>

          <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">Infanti, Bium, Medline, Clínica Mayo</span>
        </div>

        <h2> Steps followed in the investigation </h2>
         <p> After a couple of dizzying visits as an incognito buyer, I decided to interview some people.
           Finally
           I chose a woman, I explained my profession and the benefits of agreeing to be
           interviewed. </p>

        <ul>
          <li> We build a case following qualitative techniques. We develop two interviews
            <em> Ana </em>, a 36-year-old woman, married, heterosexual, mother of a son, by profession an Engineer of
            software, with a master's degree
            in neural networks. Ana lives in Bogotá in a stratum 4 apartment (she is still paying for it), and is
            a contractor of a public company (complements its
            income as an hourly professor at a capital university). The first interview was structured
            (for the panel integration process),
            then two interviews were carried out, in two-hour sessions </li>
          <li> Second, we investigate international safety standards for baby products.
          </li>
          <li> Then we analyze <strong> statistics </strong> to establish the economic and demographic of this
            market. </li>
          <li> Finally, we propose an anthropological investigation about the baby concepts that are used in
            our societies; we try to understand
            where do those concepts come from and how are they used today. </li>
        </ul>



        <h2 id = "standards"> International standards </h2>

        <p> In this section we discuss 1) some standards and procedures for babies established by <a

             href = "https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/cribs"> standards
            officers </a> in the United States (Commission for the Safety of Consumer Products); 3)
          standards

            Plus </a>, organization of the United States National Library of Medicine; 5 we analyze what
          we can learn from these
          standards in Latin America? 6) Finally, we elaborate some <strong> netnography </strong> insights,
          based on the analysis of the following visual material: </p>

        <p> In this part of the analysis we paid special attention to the following topics: </p>

          <li> Use of the corral in everyday life </li>
          <li> Staging of the corral as an important object in the construction of family memories. </li>

        <h2 id = "story"> Get a true story: ("Ana") </h2>
        <p>
          Ana always wanted to be a mother: she almost did not succeed. The obstacles were not medical, nor sentimental;
          personally,
          I think the stress and movements that her professional career forced her prolonged the wait
          more than
          wanted.
          When reading the transcripts of our interviews, it seems to me that Ana is a  typical case : in her
          experience we discovered
          that complex processes - apparently disconnected from motherhood - have an impact on decisions
          of
          <span id = "insight"> consumption </span>. </p>

        <div class = "bannerTwitero">
          <h2> Insight </h2>
          <p>
            Bium: the brand is <em> more for less </em>. The Bium pens in the segment are very competitive because
            They are outstanding in two aspects: price and safety (key element in the value proposition in the
            segment of
            baby products).
          </p>

          
        </div>
        <h2> Family </h2>
        <p> Ana was the first daughter of a more or less traditional marriage. Her mother did college,
          but
          did not complete them; her father, on the other hand, perfectly served as provider man and leader of the.
          House,
          thanks to her practice as a chemical engineer. </p>
        <p> As the oldest of three siblings Ana felt inclined to be a meticulous student and to <q> follow the
            steps of her father </q>.
          A software engineer created computer programs and had to master ("later I discovered that the one I was looking to please was myself, not my dad", she concluded in one
          of
          the sections of the interview). </p>
        <p> It is not a secret that in Latin America engineering has always been considered <em> a trade for
            men </em>.
          This brings me to my second consideration. </p>
        <h2> Gender </h2>
        <p> "I didn't want to be like my mom". When I asked Ana about the meaning of this phrase, she hesitated, and on her face she showed
           a grimace of shame. I insisted. I asked about the truncated profession of her mother (Law), about the age to
           she abandoned (19), what the causes were (the marriage with her father), and the consequences.
          Silence. </p>

        <img itemtype = "image" src = "/imagenes5/casa-bogota-madre-ana.jpg" alt = "Facade of a Bogotá house to the south"
             class = "responsiveImage">
        <figcaption> Facade of Ana's maternal home. </figcaption>


        <p> One last question occurred to me. <q>Are you mad at your mother?</q> --I said. I dont know. I ventured a
          Hypothesis: <q>Maybe that had to do with your vocational choice</q> - I suggested, but I got no answer. </p>

        <p> It seemed clear to me that <strong>Ana's consumption decisions had profoundly influenced her 
          familiar history </strong>
          (<dfn> Some psychologists refer in this way to family conflicts that inevitably
            we all drag.) </dfn> </p>
        <p> The key here is how to interpret the archetype behind Ana's decisions. Briefly: being an engineer was
          her way of
          handling various <q> family ills </q>, including the drama usually suffered by older children
          (fill father's shoes) and looks like mother (daughters' case) without being <em> too much </em> alike.
        </p>

        <p> What decisions did Ana make in this context? Fundamentally one: putting off motherhood to focus
          completely in her professional career. She did a postgraduate degree in Spain (in cutting-edge technology -
          neural networks - which makes computers <q> smarter </q>, she married another engineer of
          software,
          
          and tried to get a job at a multinational company. </p>
        <p> In other words, Ana decided to make <strong> a safe life route </strong>. All Ana's decisions
           are marked by this search for the safe (for example, it was safe to look like their father and insecure
          become a housewife, like her mother) </p>
        <p> <strong> The need for insurance also affects consumption decisions. </strong> And with this
          information that
          we can
          analyze the relationship of an Ana as mom with <strong> the purchase of baby accessories. </strong> </p>

              
                <h2 id = "C3"> Behavioral interpretation </h2>

        <p> The baby aftermarket is juicier than ever.
          Birth rates in almost all Latin American countries are rising. People like Ana want to buy.
          But
          I know
          It deals with people extremely concerned about security. Ana - the case with we accompany this
          research -  have the ability to quickly know and understand the
          baby safety information (for example, from American standards
            ). </a> </p>
        <p> In addition to the diet of information and concern for safety, let's remember the weight of certain
          archetypes of family novels (which would not be unusual to see repeated over and over again in thousands of
          consumers.)
        </p>

        <div class="bannerTwitero">
          <h2>A Behavioral interpretation of "safe" products </h2>
          <p> Four factors (birth rate, higher educational levels, ability to access and interpret the
            information and family archetypes) allow <strong> to understand Ana's consumption decision </strong> in the
            moment
            of  buying a playpen  for your baby: do not choose the most expensive, nor the largest, nor the most
            decorated, nor the one
            have
            more accessories: choose the safest according to international safety standards </a> </p>
          <p> <strong> It is not a lack of budget </strong>: it is a complex security concern. </p>
