        <p><em><span style="color: rgb(248, 156, 8);">In this article ❧ </span>This is a recap of a research developed by the French brand Pernod Ricard in Latin America, focused on 
           lifestyles and trends in the consumption of distilled drinks. They used an online communitie to analyze women who consume liquor in private
           situations. This is based on a ESOMAR report (see the footnote) </em></p>

        <div class="publicidadEnArticulo" id="oculto_publicidadEnArticulo">
        </div>
        <script src="/js/us-publicidadEnArticulo.js"></script>

        <p><strong>Women love wine, men love beer.</strong> That's true on me and false for many women I know to whom wine and beer are at the same level. Of course, 
          drinking alcohol is a way of taking off, take over inhibited behavior, so it doesn't make sense to try to talk about that as beer and wine, for example, were at odds each other.
           Maybe Pernod Ricard believed the first --women prefer wine-- so they did this.
        </p>

        <p>I think the ESOMAR report that I used for this article starts with a clever and simple idea: </p>

        <q> <dfn>One of the main challenges in the liquor industry is to achieve a real understanding of the consumers' needs. The consumption
          occasions <strong>take place a in private context</strong> where traditional techniques of research do not achieve to be suitable to deep
          understand needs, barriers and drivers of consumption towards the liquor category</dfn>.</q>

        <p>But why I am interested in: to tell you the true, Hexis is developing its own framework for developing online communities: as simple as that.</p>
        
        <h2>Private Life and Consumption</h2>
        <p>Now, there is another reason, to be honest. I turns out that I have a HUUUGE curiosity about private situations and its impact 
          on comsumption habits, and it seems that <strong>online communities are an effective way to understand consumptions
            that take place in private</strong> spheres (toilet paper or wine, for example). The authors pointed this too: </p>
          <q>So, in consideration of how to enter our consumers lives, without being intrusive, we created an online community (OC) where
            consumers came to us. This OC generated useful information not only through set activities but also through experiences.
            Panelists had the opportunity to share and recommend places, drinks, tastes and more.</q>

        <ul>
          <h2>2 things online communities are for</h2>
          <li>They leverage the power of ethnography</li>
          <li>and allow to develop deep co-creation delopment</li>
        </ul>       

        <h2> Segmentation </h2>

       <p>
         Online communities allow to perform detailed, but also clever, segmentation. You can see the evolution of the community and, as you go,
        modify the segmentation. This is kind of obvious in the following description: <q>we decided to target women that mainly like to
          go to trendy places and are willing to learn new things. Also, <strong>women who like to party, who drink alcohol</strong> regularly, and who pay
          close attention to their appearance</q>. Why would they do that? Because, online communities allow it. Think just on this:
        <q>women who like to party, who drink alcohol regularly</q>. Which woman is going to admit that in front of someone else: pardon,
        but Latin Americans are already so conservative to even admit that a woman could make decisions on public (am I overreacting? )
       </p>


           <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">
            <p class="highlight">¿ <strong>Brands</strong> in this article?</p>
            <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">Pernod Ricard</span>
          </div>


        <h2>Rewards and Behavioral Economics</h2>
        <p>
          Let's see how did they handle the motivation in the community participants:
        </p>
        <q>
          The incentive plan was designed following theoretical basis of token economy. A token economy is a system of contingency
          management based on the <strong>systematic reinforcement</strong> of target behavior. The reinforcers are symbols or "tokens" that can be exchanged
          for other reinforcers. A token economy is based on the principles of operant conditioning and <strong>behavioral economics</strong> and can be
          situated within applied behavior analysis. The aim of token economy is an increase probability of occurrence of a specific
          behavior.
        </q>
        <p>
          They considered, first, <q>Items aligned with the common topic (fashion, accessories, liquor, healthy plan, esthetic plan,
            etc.)</q>, then other mainstream and premium items and, finally, the interaction between virtual money and points according to
          type of activities and level of difficulty. So, they settled the following system:
        </p>
        <q>
          <strong>Every activity had an amount of virtual points</strong> assigned. According to the quality of the participation a certain amount of points
          was granted to users. For example, in a diary activity they could win 200 points per participation. If the user answered all the
          questions and shared videos and/or photos, she would gain 200 points. On the contrary, if the participant did not give much
          detail, it was most likely that she would obtain only 50 points.
        </q>
        <p>
          The researchers discover something that we can quite attribute to what economist called <q> marginal utility</q>. Lets'
          see: <q>We noticed that the participants who claimed prices after winning some points, as opposed to those who waited until the
            end, were more motivated to continue completing activities. The fact that they received a prize keeps them wanting more.</q>. 
            In a nutshell,<strong> marginal  utility</strong> happends when <dfn>the first unit of consumption of a good yields more utility than the second, 
              and the so</dfn>. In this case, I guess, participants getting prizes since the beginning needed at least the same dosis, so to speak, to feel
           satisfaction as participants, so they were more prone to engaged in activities, whereas participants that weren't getting prized since the
           beginning showed less interest (since <strong>they feel great pleasure just with one prize</strong> ).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is definitely an interesting issue. I remember many times --holding the position of Online community moderator-- thinking about people
          participation as something really irregular. <strong>Sometimes one can see a person participating a lot but copypasting repeated things</strong> over and over again; and the
          oppsite. So, I guess something in the middle (not to much, not too absent) is just good.
        </p>

        <h2>On Community Manangers</h2>
        <p>A Community Mananger moderates online communities, meaning by that: management of routine activities, daily talks to participants,
          solving participation issues, contacting participants, and sometimes interacting in fun (or <strong>at least polite</strong> ) ways. In some cases, they
          are told to take part in analysis teams, during the post-community (some of them used to be anthropologists). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, it is not a task easy to perform. Here you have some problems reported in this Esomar paper:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <h2>Community managers common mistakes</h2>
          <li>Not knowing how your platform works on the different devices</li>
          <li>Abuse from the private communication channels with participants (WhatsApp)</li>
          <li>Copy and paste the information for all participants</li>
          <li>Publishing without testing</li>
          <li>Over-posting and Ignored participants' comments and questions</li>
          <li>Lack of flexibility in service hours</li>
          <li><strong>Do your know that most ot the time Community Manangers are women ? But Why?</strong></li>
          
         
      </ul>

        <p>
          You see? There is a lot of responsibility on the Community managers; they expect a 24 hours compromise,
          as you can see in this excerpt: <q>During our research, we found out that the best time to contact the panelists was either <strong>at
            night or on a Sunday</strong> afternoon. Most of our participants were either full-time students or full-time employees. For this reason,
            it was not possible for us to set limited service hours. It was necessary to carry the follow up of the participants on our
            phones, and answer when they had the time to contact us.An important fact of the CM is to always have personalized communication with users (...) Developing
            personalization is not only changing a name in the email, it is creating a different relation with each participant.</q>. I' d add that
            is also important that the community platform being used provides the technological means that make nicer a job that could be kind of 
            difficult at some momentos.
        </p>

        <p>
          An interesting conclusion (a Online Community is better when is fun... well this was about wine!!!):
        </p>

        <div id="insight" class="bannerTwitero">
      
          <q>
            One of the key success factors to build online communities is to find common topics of interest, where participants not only carry
            out activities and respond to questions, but their interactions are generally focused on a specific topic area, building a space
            of interaction, attractive, fun and versatile to generate ideas and share experiences.
          </q>
